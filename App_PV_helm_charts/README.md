**Updated Directory Structure and Files**
Here's the full directory structure for the main-application Helm chart, including the sub-charts for general-job, web-frontend, and web-backend, along with the CronJob configuration, with the container port 8080.

 ```bash
main-application/
  Chart.yaml
general-job/
  Chart.yaml
  templates/
    pvc.yaml
    cronjob.yaml
web-frontend/
  Chart.yaml
  templates/
    deployment.yaml
web-backend/
  Chart.yaml
  templates/
    deployment.yaml
```

**Steps to Deploy**
1. *Navigate to the main-application directory*:
 ```bash
cd path/to/main-application
```

2. **Update dependencies**:
 ```bash
helm dependency update
```
This command will fetch and update the dependencies specified in the Chart.yaml file of the main application.

3. **Deploy the main application**:
 ```bash
helm install main-application .
```
This command installs the main application along with its dependencies (sub-charts) into your Kubernetes cluster.
