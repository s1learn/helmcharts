1. **Install Helm Version 3**:
   - Download Helm version 3 for Windows amd64 from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases).

2. **Initialize a Helm Chart Repository**:
   - Once Helm is installed, you need to add a chart repository. Check [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/) for available Helm chart repositories. Here's how to add the Bitnami chart repository:
     ```bash
     helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
     helm repo update  # Make sure we get the latest list of charts
     ```
     Output:
     ```
     Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
     ...Successfully got an update from the "bitnami" chart repository
     Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈
     ```

3. **Search the Bitnami Chart Repository**:
   - After adding the repository, you can search for charts using the following command:
     ```bash
     helm search repo bitnami
     ```

4. **Install an Example Chart (ASP.NET Core)**:
   - ASP.NET Core is an open-source framework for web application development created by Microsoft. It runs on both the full .NET Framework, on Windows, and the cross-platform .NET Core.
     ```bash
     helm install bitnami/aspnet-core --generate-name
     ```

5. **Specific Chart Details**:
   - If you want detailed information about the ASP.NET Core chart, you can use `helm show` to view its details without installation:
     ```bash
     helm show chart bitnami/aspnet-core
     ```
     Output:
     ```yaml

6. **Download Chart Package**:
   - If you want to download the Helm chart package (tgz file) without installing it, you can use `helm pull`:
     ```bash

     ```
     This command downloads the chart package (`aspnet-core-6.2.1.tgz`) to your current directory.
